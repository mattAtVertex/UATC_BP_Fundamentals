# Blueprint Components

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine 5, Blueprint Components are a feature that allows you to encapsulate functionality and data within reusable components that can be added to your Blueprints or Actors. They provide a modular approach to designing and implementing game logic by allowing you to create self-contained units of functionality that can be easily added, removed, or shared across different Blueprints.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player"><em><strong>Blueprint Components offer several advantages:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Modularity:</strong> Blueprint Components allow you to break down complex functionality into smaller, manageable units. Each component can encapsulate a specific set of behaviors and properties.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Reusability:</strong> Once you create a Blueprint Component, you can easily add it to multiple Blueprints or Actors. This promotes code reuse and saves development time.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Blueprint Components help keep your Blueprints clean and organized. Instead of having a single monolithic Blueprint, you can modularize the functionality into separate components.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Blueprint Components can be shared between team members, promoting collaboration and allowing designers and developers to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously.</p>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>In the Content Browser, right-click and select "Blueprint Class" to create a new Blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>In the "Select Parent Class" window, choose "Actor" as the parent class.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Inside the Blueprint editor, right-click in the graph editor and search for "Add Component" to add the desired components to your Blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Customize the functionality and properties of the components by adding nodes and making connections in the graph editor.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Compile and save the Blueprint Component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Once you have created a Blueprint Component, you can add it to other Blueprints or Actors by simply dragging and dropping it from the Content Browser.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Overall, Blueprint Components in Unreal Engine 5 offer a flexible and efficient way to create modular and reusable functionality within your game projects.</p>
