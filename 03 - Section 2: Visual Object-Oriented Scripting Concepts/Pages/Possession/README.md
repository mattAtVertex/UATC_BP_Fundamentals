# Possession

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine, Possession is a term used to describe the state in which a Player Controller takes control of a Pawn or Character in the game world. When a Player Controller possesses a Pawn or Character, it becomes the active player character and can be controlled by the player through input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or gamepad.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player" data-speechify-highlight="true">Possession is a critical part of the gameplay loop in Unreal Engine, as it allows players to interact with the game world and its objects through their avatars. When a player presses a key or moves a joystick, the input is sent to the Possessed Pawn or Character, which can then react and update its state accordingly.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In blueprints, Possession can be implemented using the Possess and Unpossess nodes, which allow developers to specify which Pawn or Character is being possessed or unpossessed by the Player Controller. Possession can also be used in conjunction with AI behavior trees and navigation meshes to enable NPCs to possess Pawns and Characters and interact with the player in various ways.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Overall, Possession is a crucial aspect of Unreal Engine gameplay, providing a way for players to control their avatars and interact with the game world through input devices. In blueprints, Possession can be implemented using the Possess and Unpossess nodes to manage the state and behavior of the Possessed Pawn or Character.</p>
