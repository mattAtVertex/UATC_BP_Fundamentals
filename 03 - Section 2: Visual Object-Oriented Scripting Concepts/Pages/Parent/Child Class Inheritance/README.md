# Parent/Child Class Inheritance

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine 5, Parent/Child Class Inheritance is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming that allows developers to create new classes by inheriting the functionality of existing classes.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player" data-speechify-highlight="true">Inheritance works by creating a parent class, which contains the common functionality that is shared by a group of related classes. The child classes, which inherit from the parent class, then add or override the parent class's functionality to create more specific behavior.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">For example, imagine a game where the player can choose from a variety of characters, each with different abilities and stats. The developers could create a parent class called "Character" that contains the basic functionality that all characters share, such as movement and health. They could then create child classes for each specific character, such as "Warrior" or "Mage," which inherit the functionality of the parent class and add their own unique abilities and stats.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine 5, parent/child class inheritance can be implemented using blueprints or C++. Developers can create new blueprints or C++ classes that inherit from existing ones, and then add or override their properties and functions as needed.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">One of the key benefits of parent/child class inheritance in Unreal Engine 5 is that it allows developers to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. By creating a common parent class that contains shared functionality, developers can reduce the amount of duplicated code and simplify the development process. They can also create new child classes more easily by inheriting from the parent class and adding only the necessary modifications.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Overall, parent/child class inheritance is a powerful tool in Unreal Engine 5 that can help developers to create more efficient, flexible, and maintainable code. It is widely used in game development and is essential for creating complex and sophisticated game mechanics and systems.</p>
