# Structures and Enumerators

<h2 data-speechify-highlight="true"><strong>Structures and Enumerators</strong></h2>
<p data-speechify-highlight="true">In Unreal Engine 5, Structures and Enumerators are two data types that can be used to create custom data structures that can be used in blueprints and C++ code.</p>
<h4><strong>Structures:</strong></h4>
<p>Structures are user-defined data types that can contain multiple variables of different types. They can be used to represent complex data structures, such as a character's inventory or a player's stats. Structures can be created in blueprints using the Struct Editor or in C++ using the struct keyword.</p>
<h4><strong>Enumerators:</strong></h4>
<p>Enumerators, or enums for short, are user-defined data types that define a set of named values. They can be used to represent discrete values, such as the different states of a character or the different types of weapons in a game. Enums can be created in blueprints using the Enum Editor or in C++ using the enum keyword.</p>
<h4><strong>Usage:</strong></h4>
<p>Using Structures and Enumerators in Unreal Engine 5 can provide several benefits for game developers. First, they can help to organize and simplify the data used in blueprints and C++ code, making it easier to understand and maintain. They can also help to ensure that data is consistent across different parts of the game, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Structures and Enumerators can be used in a variety of ways in Unreal Engine 5, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining custom data types for use in blueprints and C++ code</li>
<li>Representing complex data structures, such as inventories or quest logs</li>
<li>Defining the different states of a character or other game object</li>
<li>Creating custom events and functions that take advantage of these data types</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Structures and Enumerators are powerful tools in Unreal Engine 5 that can help game developers to create more flexible, organized, and maintainable code. They are widely used in game development and can be found in many aspects of game design, such as character and enemy AI, level design, and game mechanics.</p>
