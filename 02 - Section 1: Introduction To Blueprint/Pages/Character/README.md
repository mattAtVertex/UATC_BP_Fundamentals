<h2><strong>Character Class</strong></h2>
<p>In Unreal Engine, a Character Class is a blueprint class that represents a specific type of Pawn that is intended to be controlled by a player. A character is typically a humanoid or bipedal game object that can move, interact with the game world, and perform various actions.</p>
<p>Like a Pawn Class, a Character Class in blueprints is created by adding components to the character that define its functionality and behavior. Components can be added in the Components tab of the Blueprint Editor and can include things like a Mesh Component for a visual representation of the character, a Character Movement Component for player movement, or a Collision Component for detecting collisions with other objects in the game world.</p>
<p>In addition to components, a Character Class in blueprints can have its own variables and functions that can be used to manipulate its behavior and attributes. Variables can be created in the Variables tab of the Blueprint Editor and can be of different types, such as integers, floats, booleans, or object references. Functions can be created in the Event Graph tab of the Blueprint Editor and can be used to define custom behavior for the character.</p>
<p>One of the key features of a Character Class is that it can receive and respond to input from the player, allowing the player to control and manipulate the character during gameplay. Input can be sent through various means, such as keyboard and mouse, gamepad, or touch controls.</p>
<p>Overall, a Character Class in blueprints is a powerful tool that enables game developers to create complex game objects that can be controlled and manipulated by the player. It is a fundamental building block of any Unreal Engine game that focuses on player-controlled gameplay and can be used to create a wide range of gameplay mechanics and interactions.</p>
