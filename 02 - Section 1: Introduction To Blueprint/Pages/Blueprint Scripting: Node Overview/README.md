# Blueprint Scripting: Node Overview

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Blueprint scripting in Unreal Engine is a visual scripting system that allows developers and designers to create gameplay logic and interactions without writing code. It uses a node-based interface where you can create a network of interconnected nodes to define the behavior and functionality of your game objects.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Here's an overview of the different types of nodes commonly used in Blueprint scripting:</p>
<ol>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Event Nodes:</strong> These nodes are triggered by specific events, such as when the game starts, an actor overlaps with another actor, a key is pressed, etc. They act as entry points for your Blueprint logic.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Function Nodes:</strong> These nodes encapsulate a set of actions or calculations that can be reused in multiple places. They allow you to create custom functions to modularize your Blueprint scripts.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Variable Nodes:</strong> Variables store data that can be accessed and modified within your Blueprint. You can create variables of different types (e.g., integers, floats, booleans) and use nodes to set their values, get their values, and perform operations on them.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Flow Control Nodes:</strong> These nodes control the flow of execution within your Blueprint. They include nodes like branches (if-else statements), loops (for loops, while loops), and switches (switch-case statements).</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Object Nodes:</strong> These nodes allow you to interact with actors and objects in your game world. You can spawn or destroy actors, modify their properties, attach or detach components, and perform various other operations.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Math Nodes:</strong> Unreal Engine provides a range of math nodes for performing mathematical calculations. These nodes handle arithmetic operations, trigonometry, random number generation, and more.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Input Nodes:</strong> With input nodes, you can handle user input from devices like keyboards, mice, and gamepads. These nodes enable you to respond to player actions and control game behavior accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Animation Nodes: </strong>If you're working with skeletal meshes and animations, Blueprint provides nodes for controlling and blending animations, playing animation sequences, and manipulating bone transforms.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Interface Nodes:</strong> When using Blueprint Interfaces, you can use interface nodes to call functions defined in the interface and communicate between different Blueprints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">These are just a few examples of the many types of nodes available in Blueprint scripting. Unreal Engine offers a rich set of nodes and functionalities to create complex gameplay mechanics and systems using a visual scripting approach.</p>
