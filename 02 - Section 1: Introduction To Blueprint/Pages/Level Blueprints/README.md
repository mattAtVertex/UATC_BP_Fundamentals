# Level Blueprints

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine 5, Level Blueprints are a type of blueprint that provides a way to create custom logic and functionality for a specific level in a game. The Level Blueprint is associated with a specific level and is executed when the level is loaded, providing a way to implement level-specific events, triggers, and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Level Blueprints are created and edited in the same way as regular blueprints, using the visual scripting interface provided by Unreal Engine's Blueprint Editor. However, unlike regular blueprints, Level Blueprints have access to a variety of level-specific events and properties, including level streaming events, actor spawning events, and level visibility events.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Some of the key features of Level Blueprints include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Event-driven logic: Level Blueprints can be triggered by a variety of events, such as level streaming, actor spawning, and collision events. This makes them ideal for implementing level-specific gameplay mechanics, such as puzzles, traps, and enemies.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Level streaming control: Level Blueprints can be used to control the loading and unloading of levels, allowing developers to implement complex level layouts and streaming patterns.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p>Actor manipulation: Level Blueprints can be used to manipulate actors in the level, such as setting their properties, moving them, or spawning new instances. This allows developers to implement dynamic and interactive level elements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Overall, Level Blueprints provide a powerful and flexible way to implement level-specific gameplay mechanics and events in Unreal Engine 5. By using the visual scripting interface provided by the Blueprint Editor, developers can easily create custom logic and functionality for their levels, making their games more immersive and engaging.</p>
