# Blueprints (visual scripting system)

<p data-speechify-highlight="true">Blueprints are a visual scripting system in Unreal Engine that allows game developers to create gameplay mechanics, user interfaces, and interactions without the need for traditional programming. In other words, blueprints are a way for developers to create code using a visual interface, rather than writing code in a text editor.</p>
<p>Blueprints consist of nodes that represent logic and functionality, which are connected together to create a flow of execution. The nodes are organized in a graph, where each node represents a specific function, variable, or event.</p>
<p>Blueprints can be used to create a wide range of game objects and functionality, including player characters, weapons, vehicles, AI behavior, and more. They can also be used to create user interfaces, such as menus, HUDs, and interactive elements.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of using blueprints is that they allow non-programmers to create gameplay mechanics and interactions. This is because blueprints use a visual interface that is easier to understand and work with than traditional code. Additionally, blueprints can be quickly prototyped and modified, allowing developers to iterate and experiment with gameplay ideas.</p>
<p>Overall, blueprints are a powerful tool in Unreal Engine that enable developers to create complex gameplay mechanics and interactions using a visual interface, without the need for traditional programming.</p>
