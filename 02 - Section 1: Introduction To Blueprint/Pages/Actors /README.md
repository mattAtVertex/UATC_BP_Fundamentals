# Actors 

<h2><strong>Actor Class</strong></h2>
<p>In Unreal Engine, an Actor Class is a blueprint class that represents any object that can be placed in the game world and can have its own behavior and attributes. An actor can be a character, a prop, a weapon, a particle effect, or any other game object that can be placed in the game world.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">An Actor Class in blueprints is created by adding components to the actor, which define its functionality and behavior. Components can be added in the Components tab of the Blueprint Editor and include things like a Mesh Component for a visual representation of the actor, a Character Movement Component for player movement, or a Collision Component for detecting collisions with other objects in the game world.</span></p>

<p>An Actor Class can also have its own variables and functions, which can be used to manipulate its beh<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">avior and attributes. Variables can be created in the Variables tab</span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;of the Blueprint Editor and can be of different types, such as integers, floats, booleans, or object references. Functions can be created in the Event Graph tab of the Blueprint Editor and can be used to define custom behavior for the actor.</span></p>
<p>One of the key features of an Actor Class is that it can receive and respond to events that occur during gameplay. Eve<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">nts can be triggered by user input, collision detection, or other actions in the game world, and can be used to perform specific actions or trigge</span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">r other events.</span></p>
<p>Overall, an Actor Class in blueprints is a powerful tool that enables game developers to create complex game objects with custom behavior and functionality. It is a fundamental building block of any Unreal Engine game and can be used to create a wide range of gameplay mechanics and interactions.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #e03e2d;">An <strong>Actor</strong> is any object that can be placed into a level, such as a Camera, static mesh, or player start location. Actors support 3D transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. They can be created (spawned) and destroyed through gameplay code (C++ or</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #e03e2d; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;Blueprints).</span></p>
