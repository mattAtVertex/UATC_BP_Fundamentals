# Variables

<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Unreal Engine 5, variables in Blueprints are named containers that store data values which can be used by the Blueprint script to define behavior and affect game logic. Variables can store different types of data, such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and custom data types.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">In Blueprints, variables can be created in different scopes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Local variables: </strong>Variables that are defined and used within a single Blueprint function or event.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Instance variables:</strong> Variables that are defined and used within an instance of an object, such as a Blueprint Actor or Component.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Class variables:</strong> Variables that are defined at the class level and are shared by all instances of that class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Variables can be accessed and modified throughout the Blueprint script using nodes, which allow developers to read and write data values to the variable.</p>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Some of the key features of variables in Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Data storage:</strong> Variables provide a way to store data values, such as health points, ammunition, or score, that can be used by the Blueprint script to affect game logic.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Data type support:</strong> Variables can store different types of data values, including integers, floats, booleans, strings, and custom data types.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Scope control:</strong> Variables can be created in different scopes, allowing developers to control how they are accessed and used by the Blueprint script.</p>
</li>
<li class="speechify-inbox-player">
<p><strong>Node-based access:</strong> Variables can be accessed and modified throughout the Blueprint script using nodes, which provide a visual interface for reading and writing data values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="speechify-inbox-player">Overall, variables are a fundamental concept in Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints, providing a flexible and powerful way to store and manipulate data values within the Blueprint script. By using variables effectively, developers can create complex and engaging gameplay mechanics that respond to player actions and affect the game world.</p>
