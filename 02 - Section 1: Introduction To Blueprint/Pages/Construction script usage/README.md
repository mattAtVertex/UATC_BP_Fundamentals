# Construction script usage

<p>In Unreal Engine 5, the Construction Script is a blueprint function that is executed whenever an actor is placed in the game world or its properties are modified in the editor. It is responsible for setting up the initial state of an actor, including its components, variables, and other properties.</p>
<p>The Construction Script is executed at runtime when the actor is first spawned, and is also executed in the editor whenever any changes are made to the actor's properties. This allows the Construction Script to automatically update the actor's properties whenever changes are made, without requiring manual intervention from the user.</p>
<p>The Construction Script is often used to set up the initial state of an actor's components, such as adding and positioning a mesh or setting up a collision component. It can also be used to set up the actor's default values for its variables, as well as to perform any other initialization tasks that are required.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of using the Construction Script in Unreal Engine 5 is that it can help to streamline the process of setting up an actor in the game world. By automating many of the setup tasks, it can save time and reduce the risk of errors or inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Overall, the Construction Script is an important tool for game developers in Unreal Engine 5, providing a powerful and flexible way to set up the initial state of actors in the game world. It can help to streamline the development process and ensure that actors are set up correctly, quickly, and efficiently.</p>
