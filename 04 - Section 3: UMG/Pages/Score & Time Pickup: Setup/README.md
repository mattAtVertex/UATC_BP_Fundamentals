Let's right click and create a blueprint actor class. Let's name it BP_Ring.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2:</strong> Double click on our new blueprint, we need to add components to make our blueprint work. Off by adding a static mesh component and a sphere collision. Please don't forget to add a mesh to our "static mesh component", as we start off it will be empty. For myself I'm going to add a "Shape_Taurus"</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3:</strong> For the next step let's add some logic. Select the sphere collision, navigate over to the details panel on the right-hand side and create a "On Component Begin Overlap".</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4:</strong> After creating the event we will be put into the event graph. This is where we can construct the logic to pickup our collectible objects. Firstly, let's create a branch node by pulling off of our event execution pin and typing in "Branch". As for the condition to execute our true or false branch, find the "other actor" blue pin and pull off to create "does implement interface". Connect the return value which is a boolean to the condition of the branch red pin. Also be sure to set your interface to "vehicle interface".</h4>

We are going to set this to the true execution pin for a branch. We will also have a pin for target, score and time. For the target we can reroute the actor pin to also go into the target of our event.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 6:</strong> Create 2 integer variables named "score" and "time". Set them to instance edible either by ticking the box in the details panel or by clicking the closed eye next to the variable.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 7:</strong> In order to make the pickup disappear after the collision add a "destroy actor", target (self), node at the end after a pickup object event.</h4>
