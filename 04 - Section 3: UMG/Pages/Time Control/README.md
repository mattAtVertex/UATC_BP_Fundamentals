<p>As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Unreal Engine 5 had not been released. Therefore, I can provide information about time control in Blueprints as it pertains to Unreal Engine 4, which is the latest version available at that time. Please note that any specific features or updates related to time control in Unreal Engine 5 may not be covered.</p>
<p>In Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints, you have various nodes and techniques to control time-related aspects in your game. Here are some commonly used time control features in Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Delay Nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delay nodes allow you to introduce pauses or wait periods in the execution flow of your Blueprints.</li>
<li>By connecting a Delay node to other nodes, you can specify a duration, and the connected nodes will be executed after that delay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timers provide a way to schedule events to occur after a specific time interval.</li>
<li>You can create and manage timers using Blueprint nodes like "Set Timer by Event" or "Set Timer by Function Name".</li>
<li>Timers can be useful for implementing time-based actions, such as spawning enemies at regular intervals or triggering events after a certain time has passed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a Timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a Timeline node, you can right-click in the Blueprint Graph and search for "Add Timeline" or drag and drop a Timeline node from the Blueprint palette.</li>
<li>Once created, you can double-click the Timeline node to open the Timeline editor, where you can define the properties and add keyframes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are some of the basic time control features available in Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints. They provide you with the means to introduce delays, schedule events, manipulate time perception, and perform time-dependent calculations in your game or application.</p>
