<h4><strong>Step 1</strong>: To start off with let's add the pickup items to our level. Since we're driving disburse them with some distance between them so that we can accurately test.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2</strong>: Also, while we have our items selected let's check the parameters for time and score. Here we could alter them for individual rings, but their values should be set to five and one respectively.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now that we have objects to collect and we know that the variables are set, let's try hitting the play button and see what happens.</h4>
<p><strong>Let's make sure of two things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did the UI spawn an update?</li>
<li>Are the pickups working?</li>
</ul>
