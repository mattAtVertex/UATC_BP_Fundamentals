<h4>Now that we've tested the game and we know that everything is functioning properly, Let's wrap it up nicely by giving ourselves a conclusion screen.</h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Let's start off by going to our content browser and creating A new UMG widget named "BPW_GameOver_UMG"</p>
<h4><strong>Step 2:</strong> Double click on our new widget to open it up and let's add a canvas like we did before. Now let's add an image to the canvas with the following settings.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anchor: Fullscreen</li>
<li>Offsets: 0</li>
<li>Select any color</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now let's complete the menu by adding text. Add the following components as children to our canvas.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Text “Game Over”</li>
<li>Text “Final Score: 00”</li>
<li>Button with Text “Restart”</li>
</ul>
