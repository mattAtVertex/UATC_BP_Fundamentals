# End Menu Logic

<h3><strong>End Menu Logic</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let's start off by setting our final score. We are going to add a bind to the text the same way we had done in the previous menu. With the format text node we will update the value of our final score when the game is concluded.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2:</strong> For the restart button, let's add a new event "on clicked". This will open up our editor and we want to pull off the execution pin to create a "set input mode game only".&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3:</strong> It'll ask for a player controller, pull up the blue pin and type "Get player controller". Now off the last execution pin create an open level by name, set the name value to "start map".</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4:</strong> For this step let's return to the vehicle game mode. Add this code after the branch in order to show the Game over menu when the time has run out.</h4>
